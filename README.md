# barneymc

This is an implementation of the minecraft protocol in python. Also packaged
is a support for asynchat based servers, clients and proxies, plus some demos.

The demos should be instructive enough. Find me (barneygale) in #mcdevs on 
freenode if you have any questions.

2015-01-31 update: this software has not been maintained since 2012, and has
arguably never been maintained, being more of a dump of code than a real
project. Still, it served as a component in early versions of
[spock](https://github.com/nickelpro/spock).

I'm currently maintaining another protocol library, supporting minecraft
versions 1.7 and 1.8: [quarry](https://github.com/barneygale/quarry).
